###Overview of data files

Here is a brief summary of the files in the data directory:

+ **pheno.csv** Phenotype data from 3-day fear conditioning study for
490 mice from the F2 cross, and 687 mice from the F34 cross. Includes
other information such as gender, age and coat colour.

+ **geno.csv** A large table giving the genotypes sampled at 4608
markers (single nucleotide polymorphisms, or SNPs) in the F2 and F34
crosses. Most of the genotypes are marked as missing in the F2 mice
because a subset of only 162 SNPs were genotyped in these mice.

###Overview of R source code files

The code subdirectory contains several files of interest. Here are the
main ones of interest:

+ **map.qtls.R** Description of this file goes here.

+ **plot.gwscan.R** Description of this file goes here.
